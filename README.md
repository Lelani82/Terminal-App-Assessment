○ Accessibility concerns
We thought about how blind people could have an issue if wanting to use our app. Possible solutions are install a gem that converts text to speech or using a screen reader.
Not istalling any gems that could be hard for people to read (considered colour selection) or have epilepsy (considered flashing text)
